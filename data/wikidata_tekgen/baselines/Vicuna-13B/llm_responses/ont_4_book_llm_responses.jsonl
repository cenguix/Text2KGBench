For example, the relation \"depicts\" is used in the example sentence, but it is not listed in the ontology.

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to extract triples from a sentence using an ontology.\n\nTo extract triples from a sentence, you need to identify the concepts and relations present in the sentence and match them to the concepts and relations in the ontology. You can use the following steps to do this:\n\n1. Identify the main concept(s) in the sentence, which are the entities or objects that the sentence is about.\n2. Identify the related concepts in the sentence, which are the attributes or modifiers of the main concept(s).\n3. Identify the relation(s) between the concepts in the sentence, which indicate how they are related to each other.\n4. Use the ontology to determine whether the concepts and relations in the sentence are present in the ontology, and if so, how they are related.\n5. Extract the triples from the ontology that represent the relationships between the concepts in the sentence.\n\nFor example, using the ontology and sentence provided above, we can extract the following triples:\n\n* illustrator(The Story of Doctor Dolittle,Hugh Lofting)\n\nHowever, without a complete and accurate ontology and sentence to work with, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.", "triples": [["s) in the sentence", "concept", " which are the entities or objects that the sentence is about.\n2.
